# AutoOOF
Classic death sound replacer for Roblox Game Client (not affiliated in any way with the Roblox Corporation, obviously.)

Plans to eventually have a revamp with a background service so you don't have to run the script when Roblox updates.

# Usage

Install Python 3.8+ and add to PATH, if you haven't already.
Download main.py from releases and run with a terminal when roblox has updated. (Go to the folder where main.py is in cmd/powershell/cygwyn bash/mobaxterm/etc.. and run using `python ./main.py`.

But I can't understand that! I need extremely incredibly detailed steps because I'm mentally disabled!!!!!
1. Click "Releases" on the right side of this screen.
2. Click main.py on the most recent listing.
3. Go to python.org and click the download button
4. Run the installer, and check the "Add to PATH" checkbox.
5. Right click the file in your browsers downloads section, and press show containing folder.
6. Right click some blank space in the folder and then press "Open in Windows Terminal".
7. Type into the box `python ./main.py`
Repeat steps 6 and 7 when Roblox updates.
